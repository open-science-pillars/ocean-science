# podaac-arc bundle: change log

Newest first. One line per change: date, concept path, what changed, who.

_Historical note: older entries use build-era shorthand (a "close lint" is a knowledge-linter pass; red/yellow marks are nonconformant/advisory findings; check numbers refer to the linter checks documented in core/agents/knowledge-linter). The decision chains, not the labels, are what teach the standards._

- 2026-07-05 · This bundle is now a PINNED SNAPSHOT: canonical home
  established at open-science-pillars/nasa-daac-knowledge@a0c84fff959f
  (§5.7); files unchanged and byte-identical (sync_check green);
  concept edits happen in the canonical repo first from here on ·
  a later session
- 2026-07-05 · close lint: zero 🔴, three 🟡 applied on steward
  decision: swot-karin verification stamp bumped to cover the ingested
  items; load-swot and swot skills updated to ACCOMMODATE the crossover
  fact (restate lists route through Known issues; loader summary applies
  height_cor_xover and says so; flags-not-sufficient rule; new Must
  NOT). Promotion to a high gotcha deferred
- 2026-07-05 · datasets/swot-karin.md Known issues extended via the
  operational ingest loop (Tutorial 2 fresh walkthrough): crossover
  calibration arrives unapplied in ssha_karin (spurious +/-2.9 m
  cross-track ramp until height_cor_xover is added, observed PGD0
  Expert cycle 011), and CMR spatial matches can be whole passes with
  zero in-box pixels. Steward review passed
- 2026-07-04 · close lint: zero 🔴, one 🟡 (two imperative
  phrases in rapid-mocha.md), reworded to the declarative pattern per
  standing steward precedent; cross-checks vs the MHT recipe and
  compare-obs confirmed complementary, no contradictions
- 2026-07-04 · datasets/rapid-mocha.md LIVE-INGESTED via the operational
  loop: the end-to-end discovered the MOCHA official page
  links a non-scriptable SharePoint share and the canonical scriptable
  path is the dataset DOI (10.17604/3nfq-va20, AMOCatlas-indexed);
  drafted immediately, steward review passed same session (verified_by
  OSP steward review). First ingest-loop concept of the build
- 2026-07-04 · close lint: zero 🔴, four 🟡. Applied (implementing
  already-approved decisions): the relative-1e-6 remnant in
  ecco-heat-budget expected_uncertainty replaced with the approved
  absolute criterion (T1); meridional-transport's carries-no-numbers
  claim reworded after the scope-trap addition (T3); budget-formulation's
  claim of nonexistent salt/volume recipes corrected, recipes parked
 . AMS DOI 403-to-fetchers stands as accepted context
- 2026-07-04 · recipes/ecco-mht-26n.md SCOPE-CORRECTED (steward-approved):
  the earlier anchor 1.098 PW was the GLOBAL latitude circle (bare
  calc_meridional_heat_trsp), not the RAPID-comparable Atlantic section.
  Discovered by a skill-following test agent during a spot
  test, independently verified by basin decomposition (atl 0.666 + pac
  0.430 + ind 0.002 = 1.098). Recipe now carries both anchors with
  scopes; the 0.8-1.4 band is Atlantic multi-year; transport golden
  asserts both anchors and the basin-sum identity;
  meridional-transport skill gained the scope trap
- 2026-07-04 · recipes/ecco-heat-budget.md tolerance RE-GROUNDED on
  measurement (steward-approved): the relative-1e-6 criterion replaced by
  absolute max 1e-10 degC/s pointwise (p99.9 1e-11). The ocean_budget
  golden's first run showed relative ratios up to 9e-2 on a CORRECT
  formulation because float32 storage quantization exceeds quiescent-cell
  term magnitudes; measured residuals: max 4.95e-11, median 5.7e-14
  degC/s over 3.34M cell-months. budget-formulation.md aligned
- 2026-07-04 · full-bundle lint: zero 🔴; the an earlier session
  standing check-8 pair CLOSED (all four high gotchas now match real
  eval cases); three check-11 rewordings applied on steward decision
  (ghrsst-mur house-rule phrasing, ecco-v4r4 never-mix imperative,
  swot-karin crid imperative). All 14 external URLs 200 this run
- 2026-07-04 · six arc concepts authored and steward-verified
  (verified_by OSP steward review): swot-karin (granule-verified structure,
  crid attribute, 39% valid-fraction normalization), swot-calval-orbit-phases
  (reproducible C-vs-D probes), grace-fo-mascons (RL06.3 v4), both GRACE
  gotchas (GIA severity medium per recorded rationale, steward-confirmed),
  ghrsst-mur (analysis-error framing)
- 2026-07-04 · close lint (incremental): zero 🔴, three new 🟡
  resolved on steward decision: heat-budget recipe reworded to the
  owned-by pattern (check 11), inputs expanded to exact ShortNames
  (check 12), and the residual-threshold contradiction reconciled
  (budget-formulation's unsupported 1e-9-relative claim corrected to
  round-off/epsilon framing; recipe's 1e-6 relabeled as conservative
  pass tolerance). Standing check-8 pair unchanged (then pending)
- 2026-07-04 · recipes/ecco-mht-26n.md, recipes/ecco-heat-budget.md
  authored with the live 2010 reproducing run (MHT 26.5N mean 1.098 PW,
  monthly series recorded) and tutorial provenance; steward review
  passed, both verified (verified_by OSP steward review)
- 2026-07-04 · steward review passed: all three ECCO concepts verified
  (verified_by OSP steward review). Linter run first: zero 🔴, four 🟡; the two
  check-11 findings resolved by applying the linter's rewordings (policy
  phrasing moved out of concept bodies; refusal owned by ocean-budget);
  the two check-8 findings (eval cases native-grid-refusal and
  geothermal-omission are placeholders) stand until a later session authors
  the cases
- 2026-07-04 · datasets/ecco-v4r4.md, gotchas/ecco-native-vs-regridded.md,
  gotchas/ecco-geothermal-flux.md drafted with evidence from the earlier
  ShortName audit (51 collections, CMR), live access tests (geometry +
  THETA 2010, 208.75 MB), and the tutorial-verified budget formulation;
  status draft pending steward review (drafted by build
  assistant; steward review)
